    <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left">Cool Christams facts...1) “Silent Night” is the most recorded Christmas song in history, with over 733 different versions copyrighted since 1978. 2) Though Santa Claus has worn blue and white and green in the past, his traditional red suit came from a 1930s ad by Coca Cola. 3) “White Christmas” is the best-selling song of all time. 4) Rudolph was actually conceived by a department store, Montgomery Ward, as a marketing gimmick to get kids to buy holiday coloring books. 5) The original lyrics to “Hark! The Herald Angel Sings” were “Hark! How the Welkin rings!” Welkin is an old, English term for Heaven. A preacher later tweaked the lyric. 6)  Rudolph was almost named Rollo or Reginald. Reginald the Red-Nosed Reindeer doesn’t quite have the same ring to it. 7) “Jingle Bells” was originally supposed to be a Thanksgiving song. 8) Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” is considered to be the most popular Christmas song now. 9) Over the years, other reindeer have been name checked on Santa’s sleigh team, such as: Flossie, Glossie, Racer, Pacer, Scratcher, Feckless, Ready, Steady, and Fireball (no relation to the whiskey). 10) And the highest-grossing Christmas movie of all time is How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The Jim Carrey version. </marquee>
